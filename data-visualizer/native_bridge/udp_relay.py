"""
Relays UDP packets arriving on the real Windows adapter (192.168.1.2:6201,
the address the LiDAR is configured to stream to) into WSL, where
lidar_bridge actually listens. Needed because WSL2's default NAT network
doesn't own 192.168.1.2, so inbound sensor data would otherwise never
reach it. Outbound (WSL -> sensor) already works fine via normal NAT and
needs no relay.

WSL's NAT IP changes across restarts, so it's auto-detected at startup
rather than hardcoded.
